# Tutorial (Short)

1. Keep your hands in the starting position, from which you want to drive.

2. Then an option will come to select bounding box. Make rectangle exactly across hands.

3. Until the timer finishes, keep your hand within the boxes. Then after finishing of timer, the movement of your hands outside the circle will simulate keypress. Make sure the game is open before timer finishes.

The full tutorial of this project will be posted on Medium soon.
